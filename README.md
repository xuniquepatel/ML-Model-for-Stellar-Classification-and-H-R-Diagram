# ⭐ ML Model for Stellar Classification and H-R Diagram

A Random Forest-based ML model classifies stars based on attributes like color index, luminosity, temperature, and spectral type. It also generates an H-R diagram to illustrate stellar distribution. The model demonstrates high accuracy and potential for future expansion with broader datasets and advanced astrophysical analysis.
